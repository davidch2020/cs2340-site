    <h1>Study Buddy</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Study Buddy is a study tracking app for students. The purpose of the app is to create study goals, track goal completion, and meet 
      groups of students to study with. We developed Study Buddy in Android Studio using Java. 
    </p>
    <h2>Design & Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      Study Buddy uses the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. MVVM is commonly used in Android projects. Model holds the data and business
      logic of the application.
